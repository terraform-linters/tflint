# Writing Plugins

If you want to add or change rules, you need to write plugins. When changing plugins, refer to the repository of each plugin and refer to how to build and install.

If you want to create a new plugin, please refer to [tflint-ruleset-template](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-template). The plugin can use [tflint-plugin-sdk](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-plugin-sdk) to communicate with the host process. You can easily create a new repository from "Use this template".
