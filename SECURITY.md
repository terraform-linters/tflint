# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

TFLint always supports only the latest version and does not provide security updates for older versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please do not report it in an issue or a discussion. You can discuss vulnerabilities internally with maintainers using [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
