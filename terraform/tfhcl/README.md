# Forked `hcl/ext/dynblock` package

This package is a fork of [`github.com/hashicorp/hcl/ext/dynblock`](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/tree/main/ext/dynblock). TFLint maintains its own dynblock implementation to support not only dynamic blocks, but also count/for_each meta-arguments in the HCL layer.
