// Plan is the top-level type representing a planned set of changes.
//
// A plan is a summary of the set of changes required to move from a current
// state to a goal state derived from configuration. The described changes
// are not applied directly, but contain an approximation of the final
// result that will be completed during apply by resolving any values that
// cannot be predicted.
//
// A plan must always be accompanied by the configuration it was built from,
// since the plan does not itself include all of the information required to
// make the changes indicated.
type Plan struct {
	// Mode is the mode under which this plan was created.
	//
	// This is only recorded to allow for UI differences when presenting plans
	// to the end-user, and so it must not be used to influence apply-time
	// behavior. The actions during apply must be described entirely by
	// the Changes field, regardless of how the plan was created.

	// PrevRunState and PriorState both describe the situation that the plan

	// PrevRunState is a representation of the outcome of the previous
	// Terraform operation, without any updates from the remote system but
	// potentially including some changes that resulted from state upgrade
	// actions.
	//
	// PriorState is a representation of the current state of remote objects,
	// which will differ from PrevRunState if the "refresh" step returned
	// different data, which might reflect drift.
	//
	// PriorState is the main snapshot we use for actions during apply.
	// PrevRunState is only here so that we can diff PriorState against it in
	// order to report to the user any out-of-band changes we've detected.

// This function represents our main business logic for making the decision

		//
		// (We don't treat a "refresh only" plan as applyable in normal
		// planning mode because historically the refresh result wasn't
		// considered part of a plan at all, and so it would be
		// a disruptive breaking change if refreshing alone suddenly
		// became applyable in the normal case and an existing configuration
		// was relying on ignore_changes in order to be convergent in spite
		// of intentional out-of-band operations.)
